# Why make a malicious ddos app? - contrivercial discussion
Why did I make this? Is it becaues I was bored? Yes.
If I went to a community of programmers and asked for some help on a bug relating to my nasty ddos script, no one would help.
They'd all winge to me that I'm a horrible person, and that they won't help me with anything related to making an "oh so horrible ddos application".
I think they're all pussies. Faggots, and morons. They're second to a Christian with how smooth their tiny brains flop around in their soft puny skulls.
If I wanted to make something worse, like a virus, I would. In fact- I did. You know what my school's IT guy said when he found out about my amazing troll-lol-lol virus?
He wasted 10 minutes of my time after class, and talked to me about "going away from the dark side", and how it's evil to make malicious software. After that, I started to believe
that the majority of programmers that hang around stackoverflow, reddit, discord coding servers, are apart of a secret lghdtvabcdefg+- cult, and that they should all be exterminated immediately.

So basically. lgHdTvGayLezbians+- are secretly learning to code, and that's bad. Monkey see, monkey exterminate.


# BadDDOS
I named my app BadDDOS because I knew I would never make anything as good as Low Orbital Ion Cannon DDOS.
Who knows though. Maybe Wurst mc client isn't as bad as it sounds, and so mine hopefully won't be ¯\(ツ)/¯

# Deprecated Java Release
I used JavaFX to make the GUI of this release. I couldn't stand it, so I switched to RayGUI in C instead.
The latest java release is still available, but it only supports UDP Spamming. No TCP, or Arp Spoofing, nothing cool like a MITM attack.
