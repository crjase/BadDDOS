# BadDos
### Differences
DOS  - Denial-of-service (real sexy, mighty, and powerful)<br>
DDOS - Distributed-Denial-of-service (kinda gay, team bashing a server)
<br><br>
### All supported modes and functions
Disclaimer: Keep in mind that this is in development, and currently, the only available modes are the one's coloured ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}GREEN}}$<br>
And anything coloured ${\textsf{\color{orange}ORANGE}}$ means it is being worked on...<br><br>
${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}UDP Spamming}}$  -   Spams sizeable data to a UDP port like a derranged monkey<br><br>
**TCP Spamming**  -   Holds open a port and spams sends chunky packets, or even tiny fragmented little ones<br><br>
${\textsf{\color{orange}ARP Spoofing}}$  -   Pretends to be a device on a local network and sucks up all the traffic so the device can't utilize the network<br><br>
**MITM Attack**   -   Pretends to be a device on a local network and captures it's data.<br><br>
**Upcoming Unnamed Thiny Maggigy**  -  I've seen it somewhere on an android spoofer thing. It can capture website data on a device, then send it back as a modified version. So I should be able to modify the content of a webpage; and send it back to the device. It'll definitely be my favorite mode...

### What this application can do
My. This, precious app. BadDOS is really very cool. It is able to run on windows/linnux with a stylish GUI. This amazing denial-of-service application includes a bunch of different tools designed to block a connection to something-weather it be a wifi signal, or even radio (requires an antenna LOL). This tool's got you covered on it all. Hell you can even act like a monkey and spam 100,000 threads of my famous UDP Spamming Mode, all on one computer! Wow, isn't that just amazing?
<br><br>
### Why call it BadDOS?
I named my app BadDos, because I knew I'd never make anything as good as Low Orbital Ion Cannon.<br>
Who knows though. Maybe Wurst mc client isn't as bad as it sounds, and so mine hopefully won't be ¯\(ツ)/¯

# Why make a malicious ddos app? - contrivercial discussion
Why did I make this? Is it becaues I was bored? Yes.
If I went to a community of programmers and asked for some help on a bug relating to my nasty ddos script, no one would help.
They'd all winge to me that I'm a horrible person, and that they won't help me with anything related to making an "oh so horrible ddos application".
I think they're all pussies. Faggots, and morons. They're second to a Christian with how smooth their tiny brains flop around in their soft puny skulls.
If I wanted to make something worse, like a virus, I would. In fact- I did. You know what my school's IT guy said when he found out about my amazing troll-lol-lol virus?
He wasted 10 minutes of my time after class, and talked to me about "going away from the dark side", and how it's evil to make malicious software. After that, I started to believe
that the majority of programmers that hang around stackoverflow, reddit, discord coding servers, are apart of a secret lghdtvabcdefg+- cult, and that they should all be exterminated immediately.
