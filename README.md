#BadDDOS
I named my app BadDDOS because I knew I would never make anything as good as Low Orbital Ion Cannon DDOS.
Who knows though. Maybe Wurst mc client isn't as bad as it sounds, and so mine hopefully won't be ¯\(ツ)/¯

#Deprecated Java Release
I used JavaFX to make the GUI of this release. I couldn't stand it, so I switched to RayGUI in C instead.
The latest java release is still available, but it only supports UDP Spamming. No TCP, or Arp Spoofing, nothing cool like a MITM attack.
