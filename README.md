# Release Status
Currently, the C/C++ version is being worked on. The old version is downloadable, but that's it for now.<br>
This new version will be awesome though, but don't expect it to be done in just a few months.<br>
The release will come as soon as I finish the GUI, and am done with the Arp Spoofer script.<br>
As for the other modes and functions; they will gradually be added whenever I am working on this project.

# BadDos
### Differences
DOS  - Denial-of-service (real sexy, mighty, and powerful)<br>
DDOS - Distributed-Denial-of-service (kinda gay, team bashing a server)
<br><br>
### Why call it BadDOS?
I named my app BadDos, because I knew I'd never make anything as good as Low Orbital Ion Cannon.<br>
Who knows though. Maybe Wurst mc client isn't as bad as it sounds, and so mine hopefully won't be ¯\(ツ)/¯
<br><br>
### What this application can do
My. This, precious app. BadDOS is really very cool. It is able to run on windows/linnux with a stylish GUI. This amazing denial-of-service application includes a bunch of different tools designed to block a connection to something-weather it be a wifi signal, or even radio (requires an antenna LOL). This tool's got you covered on it all. Hell you can even act like a monkey and spam 100,000 threads of my famous UDP Spamming Mode, all on one computer! Wow, isn't that just amazing?
<br><br>
### All supported modes and functions
**Disclaimer:** Keep in mind that this is in development, and currently, the only available modes are<br>
the one's coloured ${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}GREEN}}$. And anything coloured ${\textsf{\color{orange}ORANGE}}$ means it is being worked on...<br><br>
${\textsf{\color{lightgreen}UDP Spamming}}$  -   Spams sizeable data to a UDP port like a derranged monkey<br><br>
**TCP Spamming**  -   Holds open a port and spams sends chunky packets, or even tiny fragmented little ones<br><br>
${\textsf{\color{orange}ARP Spoofing}}$  -   Pretends to be a device on a local network and sucks up all the traffic so the device can't utilize the network<br><br>
**MITM Attack**   -   Pretends to be a device on a local network and captures it's data.<br><br>
**Upcoming Unnamed Thiny Maggigy**  -  I've seen it somewhere on an android spoofer thing. It can capture website data on a device, then send it back as a modified version. So I should be able to modify the content of a webpage; and send it back to the device. It'll definitely be my favorite mode...
